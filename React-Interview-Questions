Q1  Explain virtual dom and its role in React?
Ans.. The virtual DOM is the light weight javascript representation of (DOM) Document Object Model that react use to 
optimise how changes applied to the dom.
The Virtual DOM role in react is to improve performance by:-
1: Reducing Expensive DOM Opertaion :--- The virtual dom updated faster than actual dom. so react can make changes to the virtual DOM more
cheaply.

2: Identifed and Updating only affected Parts:---- When a component state changes react compare the new Virtual DOM tree to the previous one,
and only update the part that are different.

// Virtual DOM is Key React Features that enhance performance and efficient UI updates.



Q2  How does react handle event Handling?
Ans... Handling event in react is similar to handling event on Dom Elements
:--- React Event names as camelCase rather than Lowercase.
:--- With JSX you can pass a function as event handler, rather than string.
for example--

<button onclick ="activeLeaser()">
Active Leaser
</button>

is slightly different in React:-
<button onClick ={activateLeaser}>
Activate Leaser
</button>


Q3 How can we handle error in React?
Ans... There are different type of errors in React:-
1- Syntax Error
2- Reffernce Error
3- Type Error
4- Components lifecycle error

Error boundries were introduce in react v16 and to use them you need to define the class component within either or both of the following lifecycle method:-
getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch() :---this lifecycle method rendeers fallback UI after an error is thrown.



Q4 How does react handle component state and Props?
Ans... while both holds the information that influences the output and render they are different in one important way (similar to the function parameter)
where state is managed within the component (similar to the function within the function).


Q5  What is JSX?
Ans...  Javascript XML (JSX) is a syntax extension for javascript that allow you to write a HTML code in react a Javascript Library.
JSX is similar to html , but it is stricker and can display dynamic information . It is extension of the javascript language on ES6.
